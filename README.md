Problem Set 4 of Native App Studio on the University of Amsterdam: A To-do list.

This app contains a to-do list. Items are stored in a SQL database. 
Items can be added at the bottom, edited by clicking them and deleted by long-pressing them. 
Items can also be checked and unchecked.
On closing and rotation, the app retains it saved state through use of the database.
